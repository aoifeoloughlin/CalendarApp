The Calendar Month-View page:
  Initial Goal: 
    The original plan was to create a working calendar in the monthly view setting. In this calendar the user could add and remove events to and from the calendar. The user could also see their "friends" events as well, this was so they could see if they had any free days at the same time and could therefore meet up.
    
    Final Goal: 
    The calendar can add and remove the user's own personal events, as well as display all the events on a certain date on a pop up. The user can trigger this pop up when they click on the day's number. Regarding the addition and removal of events, there are two seperate dropdowns for each option. The addition of an event is completed by clicking the dropdown, entering in the details of the event, such as the date and the event name. The removal of the event is accomplished by clicking the remove dropdown and entering the date of the event the user wants to delete. Then, they must click the search events button which will display an options list that will contain all the event that the user has written to that day. The user may then select the event they want to remove and it will be removed from the database.
    Unfortuanetly due to unforseen circumstances, the team could not accomplish the idea of linking the friend's events with the user's events on the calendar view. However; fortunately this allows the calendar to have a simple and clear appearance which can be easily operated.
